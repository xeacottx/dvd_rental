About
=====

.. todo:: (Set ``todo_include_todos = False`` in ``docs/conf.py`` to hide this)

   A more detailed description about the project.

   All TODO items on this page are part of the pop template, and should be
   reviewed and replaced with actual content.

   This page is the ``README.rst`` page that appears on a repo site, such as
   GitHub/GitLab, but also is what appears on the PyPI landing page of a published
   python project. Sphinx docs, by default, include the contents of this file
   in the published docs.

What is POP?
------------

This project is built with `pop <https://pop.readthedocs.io/>`__, a Python-based
implementation of *Plugin Oriented Programming (POP)*. POP seeks to bring
together concepts and wisdom from the history of computing in new ways to solve
modern computing problems.
